        <p>The lion belongs to the carnivorous, the worldâ€™s second-largest of the carnivorous, with a male weight of 250 kilograms. <br>

            It has great physical strength, making him take the lead among animals and taking the title of king of the jungle. Lion lives in small groups that form interconnected families. These families are made up of lion, lioness and their young babies, and settle in a rock house called den. <br>
            
            Lion has teeth, strong claws help him catch his prey. It lurks prey and waits for the right time to attack it, he jumps up her neck to cut off her artery and it dies instantly. <br>
